## Game that I like is Counter Strike

### The Counter Strike franchise is a great franchise. I have over 4k hours played from the past couple years. Where I think the game excells is the shooting mechanics. While it seems very simple, there is a defined recoil pattern for each weapon. This makes each interaction ingame against other people rather interesting as it is purely based on how skillful someone is at shooting compared to others. I think another aspect that is always changing is the map design. Counter Strike map design has been known to be one of the best around. Maps includes skyboxes/ other ingame element that may be invisible to players but when taken into account, it can be base for tactics. For example, smoke linups or grenade linups where each is defined by finding pixel perfect spots. These can make up for very different scenarios which makes up for more fun times when playing. Another aspect that is also overlooked by newer players is the idea of timing. Like most shooters, maps and spawns are purposefully placed which directs how one would act in one round. That is mostly what I love about counter strike.
